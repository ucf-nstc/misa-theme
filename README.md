This website uses a Content Management System called Bludit. This allows non-technical users to edit content via a web interface rather than having to edit html and css manually. You can read more about bludit at [https://www.bludit.com/](https://www.bludit.com/)

The actual website mostly consists of a theme, stored in the bl-themes/build/ folder. That folder has all of the site styles and the structure of the pages. The bl-content/ folder has the site content, including the pages, images and database of users.

The theme folder only contains the minimum files necessary to display the website to the user. These files shouldn't be edited directly on the server (it's considered a bad practice). Instead, you can take a look at the complete project files including all of the build tools and helpers like [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) and certain [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) modules like [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) at this project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ucf-nstc/bludit-theme). If you haven't learned how to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) yet, that should be the first thing you do. Git is a version control software that helps you keep track of changes you make to your code. GitHub is a place where you can store that tracked code.

If you're working on this project and are confused about any of the above concepts or tools, but you still want to adhere to the best practices, you can contact me at [tindleaj@gmail.com](mailto:tindleaj@gmail.com) or if I still work at the school, then [austin.tindle@ucf.edu](austin.tindle@ucf.edu).
